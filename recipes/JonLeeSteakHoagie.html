        <h1>Jon Lee Steak Hoagie</h1>
        <img src="sandwich.jpg">
        <p> The Jon Lee Steak Hoagie was born before my time, but I was fortunate enough to come along in an appropriate window of opportunity.</p>

        <p>This sandwich was a favorite off menu item of the employees of Attractions restaurant, utilized to shake up the monotony off on menu items or as a mild to moderate hangover cure.</p>

        <p>The sandwich gets its name from its creator, Attractions kitchen manager Jon Lee.</p>
        
        <p>This divine creation takes a traditional beef hoagie patty and incorporates intense flavors from all directions, including buffalo sauce, cajun mayo, garlic herb butter, and two kinds of cheese.</p>
