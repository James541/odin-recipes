        <h1>Jon Lee Steak Hoagie</h1>
        <img src="sandwich.jpg">
        <p> The Jon Lee Steak Hoagie was born before my time, but I was fortunate enough to come along in an appropriate window of opportunity.</p>

        <p>This sandwich was a favorite off menu item of the employees of Attractions restaurant, utilized to shake up the monotony of on menu items or as a mild to moderate hangover cure.</p>

        <p>The sandwich gets its name from its creator, Attractions kitchen manager Jon Lee.</p>
        
        <p>This divine creation takes a traditional beef hoagie patty and incorporates intense flavors from all directions, including buffalo sauce, cajun mayo, garlic herb butter, and two kinds of cheese.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 beef hoagie patty</li>
            <li>1 steak hoagie roll</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayo</li>
            <li>2 tsp cajun seasoning</li> 
            <li>1/2 cup shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>2 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices of provolone cheese</li>
            <li>garlic herb butter for brushing the hoagie roll</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
  
        <ol>

            <li>Lightly toast hoagie roll in toaster or over, set aside</li>
            <li>Combine mayo and cajun seasoning, stir, set aside</li>
            <li> Place hoagie patty on hot grill for 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> Flip hoagie patty, and brush generously with buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>After 1-2 minutes, flip patty again, and brush generously with buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>While patty continues to cook, brush both top and bottom pieces of roll with garlic herb butter</li>
            <li>Place roll pieces directly on grill</li>
            <li>Place the four slices of cheese on the upward facing top section of the roll, alternating cheddar and provolone across the length of the roll</li>
            <li>Grill until a golden brown crusts forms on the grill facing roll pieces (this may happen very quickly, and it is easy to burn, so please pay close attention)</li>
            <li>Remove roll pieces and set aside, cheese will continue to melt</li>
            <li>Flip hoagie patty two additional times, brushing with buffalo sauce each time, letting each side briefly grill for 20-30 seconds</li>
            <li>Spread cajun seasoning and mayo mixture on the ungrilled bottom section of the roll</li>
            <li> Add shredded lettuce on top of mayo spread</li>
            <li>Remove patty from grill and place on top of shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>Place top section of hoagie roll on top of patty</li>
            <li>Cut in half, grab extra napkins, sit down, take a deep breath</li>
            <li>Enjoy this marvelous creation, goes well with a side of fries</li>
