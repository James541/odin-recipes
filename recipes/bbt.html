        <h1>Bacon Basil Tomato Sanwich</h1>
       <img src="bbt.jpg">

       <p> A modified take on the classic bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich. This creation makes a few minor tweaks that snowball into big flavor results.</p>

       <p>This recipe is the foundational sandwich, but it doesn't have to end here. Adding sliced turkey was a well liked modification in the bistro this sandwich was served. Adding a grilled chicken breast would also be more than appropriate.</p>
       
       <p>Replacing the widely used lettuce with a pile of fresh basil leaves is the superstar move that makes this sandwich special. In addition, peppercorn aioli replaces plain mayo, and instead of cooking your bacon the old fasion way, out bacon gets candied with the addition of brown sugar. Sound weird? Well, you're wrong.</p>
